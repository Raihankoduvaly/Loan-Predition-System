Loan Approval Prediction
This project predicts the approval of loans based on a dataset of historical loan data. The goal is to automate the loan application review process by using machine learning to classify whether an applicant's loan will be approved or rejected.

Overview
Loan approval prediction is a classification problem where we aim to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on features such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

This project includes:

Data preprocessing
Model training and evaluation
Web-based prediction system (frontend + backend)
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS
Backend: Python (Flask)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
